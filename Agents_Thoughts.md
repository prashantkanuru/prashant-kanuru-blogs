# Agents & GenAI Workflows 
___
A recent report from MIT (around 19th-20th August)stating that 95% of GenAI projects are not yielding cost savings or returns (RoI - would require revenue or revenue - expenses) at all or atleast on the expected lines. 
This convinced me that this is the best time to put forward my thoughts on the same aka, GenAI or GenAI Agents and workflow and what I feel is the right way ahead.

## Design Principles:
- Memory
- Starting with as assumption that LLMs (top tier LLMs) can act as a pseudo replacement for FTEs
- Keeping the Human-in-Loop
- Creating a fertile ground for breeding a Exploration vs. Exploitation approach - this needs capturing trajectories as much as possible
- Milking the language head of the LLMs (aka on the lines of entropy/perplexity, confidence and beam-search)
- Milking the OSS models to understand how the context changes the probabilities
- Creation of Verifiable rewards and baselines on the fly or deterministically where not available to make possible self-improvement at inference time
